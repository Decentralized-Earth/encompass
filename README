Encompass - lightweight multi-coin client

Encompass consolidates support for various currencies into one wallet. It is a BIP-0044-compliant multi-currency wallet based on Electrum. This Encompass client uses Electrum servers of supported currencies to retrieve necessary data, so no "Encompass server" is necessary.

1. GETTING STARTED
------------------
First thing you need to do is run:
  pyrcc4 icons.qrc -o gui/qt/icons_rc.py

If you do not have pyrcc4 on your system, you may need to install the PyQt4-devel package first.


To run Encompass from this directory, just do:

  ./encompass

If you install Encompass on your system, you can run it from any
directory:

  sudo python setup.py install
  encompass


To start Encompass from your web browser, see

2. HOW OFFICIAL PACKAGES ARE CREATED
------------------------------------

contrib/encompass-release
 
The 'build' script will perform all the necessary tasks to 
create a release from release-tagged github sources

If all runs correctly, you'll find a release set in the 
contrib/encompass-release/releases directory, complete with 
md5/sha1 sums, and gpg signatures for all files. 

Additional documentation is provided in the README in that dir.


### TODO:
On Mac OS X:

  # On port based installs
