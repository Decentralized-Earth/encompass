Encompass - lightweight multi-coin client

Encompass consolidates support for various currencies into one wallet. It is a BIP-0044-compliant multi-currency wallet based on Electrum. This Encompass client uses Electrum servers of supported currencies to retrieve necessary data, so no "Encompass server" is necessary.
